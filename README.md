# Stalk: Because Tracking Changes is Just Too Mainstream

So you've stumbled upon the marvel that is Stalk. It's not just an observable variable; it's a lifestyle choice, really. Because, you know, tracking changes to variables is so mainstream. Let's make it obscurely cooler with Stalk.

## Usage

### Initialization: The Hipster's Way

Create a new `Stalk` instance, and feel the rush of being different:

```javascript
const myStalk = new Stalk(initialValue);
```

### Getting the Value: Old School, Yet Necessary

Retrieve the current value with an air of indifference:

```javascript
const currentValue = myStalk.get;
```

### Setting the Value: Because Conformity is Boring

Set a new value like a rebel:

```javascript
myStalk.set = newValue;
```

### Listening for Changes: Because Who Needs Peace and Quiet?

Register a callback to be the life of the party whenever the value changes:

```javascript
myStalk.onChange = (newValue, oldValue) => {
  console.log(`Oh, look! The value changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}. Shocking.`);
};
```

## Example: Because Examples are Soooo Original

```javascript
const temperatureStalk = new Stalk(25);

// Registering a callback for changes
temperatureStalk.onChange = (newTemperature, oldTemperature) => {
  console.log(`Temperature changed from ${oldTemperature}째C to ${newTemperature}째C. Groundbreaking.`);
};

// Updating the temperature value
temperatureStalk.set = 30;
```

## SyncStalk: Tracking Changes Across Universes

Introducing SyncStalk! It's like Stalk, but synchronized across different dimensions. Perfect for when you need to observe changes in one reality and reflect them in another. Stay in sync, across worlds.

### Usage

The usage of SyncStalk is similar to Stalk, but with the added dimension of inter-dimensional synchronization. Initialize, get, set, and listen for changes just like you would with Stalk, but now with the power to bridge parallel universes.

```javascript
const mySyncStalk = new SyncStalk(initialValue);
```

SyncStalk allows you to keep track of changes across realities:

```javascript
mySyncStalk.updateViewPublic((value) => {
  console.log(`Public view updated with value: ${value}.`);
});

mySyncStalk.updateViewPrivate((value) => {
  console.log(`Private view updated with value: ${value}.`);
});
```

And of course, you can still send data to the network or receive data from an external source, seamlessly traversing the multiverse.

```javascript
mySyncStalk.sendData(sendDataToNetwork);
mySyncStalk.receiveData(receivedData);
```

### Potential Applications: Because SyncStalk is So Versatile

- **Real-time Collaboration Across Platforms**: Use SyncStalk to synchronize data changes across different platforms or devices, enabling real-time collaboration without the need for manual updates.
  
- **Cross-Platform Gaming**: Implement SyncStalk to synchronize game state and player actions across multiple platforms or game instances, providing a seamless gaming experience regardless of the device.
  
- **Multi-Device Application Synchronization**: Build applications that sync user preferences, settings, or data across various devices, ensuring a consistent experience for users on different platforms.
  
- **Distributed System Monitoring**: Employ SyncStalk to monitor system metrics or events across distributed systems, allowing administrators to track changes and respond promptly to potential issues.

## Example: SyncStalk in Action

```javascript
const temperatureSyncStalk = new SyncStalk(25);

// Registering a callback for changes
temperatureSyncStalk.updateViewPublic((newTemperature, oldTemperature) => {
  console.log(`Public temperature changed from ${oldTemperature}째C to ${newTemperature}째C. Inter-dimensional sync in progress.`);
});

// Updating the temperature value across dimensions
temperatureSyncStalk.updateDataPublic(30);
```

Feel free to Stalk, and sync across universes.
